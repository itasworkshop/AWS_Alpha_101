IAM --> Identity and Access Management

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

User Group
--> an umbrella term having collection of settings or permissions to assign more than one user
example --> 4 testers in company having similar access to resources under "Tester" group

User
user are different from root user with only assigned access and permission and policies

Demo
we created user dev-1 under group developers group which has permission only to EC2 and S3
so when we enable console login and provide password we can sign in and access to only assigned group permissioned services(S3 and EC2) and access to other services gives us Error.
