AWS Lambda- Serverless computation

-Focus only on computation requirement.

-You pay only for the compute time that you consume â€” there is no charge when your code is not running. 

-With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration.


example computation:- python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print(event)
    return 'Hello from Lambda!'
